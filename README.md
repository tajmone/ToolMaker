= ToolMaker

== What it is

ToolMaker is a set of tools to make compilers, analyzers and similar
tools. It creates a lexcial scanner (like `lex` et.al) and a parser
(like `yacc` et.al). But in addition it can also generate a lister
(modules handling input text and error messages). It is also build on
top of a powerful macro tool, `imp`, similar in function to m4 and
others.

== License

This is a project which contains original work by Kenth Ericsson,
Jerker Willander and others at SoftLab AB Sweden, including
myself. SoftLab as sold to Rational Software in 1997 which then resold
that to Ericsson some years later.

Although this would strictly be copyrighted material, but considering

- me being one of its authors and also one of the owners of SoftLab
- the almost 20 years that has gone by
- the low commercial value in this technology, given that there are a
  multitude of other tools available
- the missing documentation
- that I am willing to take this down if anyone objects

I'm making this repo of resurrected sources available, mostly for my
own use. Please consult me before creating forks.
