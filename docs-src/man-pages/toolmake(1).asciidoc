== NAME

toolmake -- create a ToolMaker subsystem


== SYNOPSIS

*toolmake* [-help] [<option> ...] <name>


== DESCRIPTION

*Toolmake* is a facility to help you to create a SoftLab ToolMaker subsystem, i.e. *toolmake* will create the appropriate files for you in order to let you concentrate on the essential tasks when writing a ToolMaker subsystem.

*Toolmake* currently supports _ParserMaker_, _ScannerMaker_ and _ListerMaker_. You can choose any combination of these to include into
your subsystem.
Furthermore *toolmake* will offer you an example main
module and a Makefile, all in order to make life easier for you as an
application (or compiler) implementor.

Essentially what *toolmake* will do is to generate a set of files, all under your supervision.
*Toolmake* will not overwrite anything unless you explicitly tells it to do so.

Normally *toolmake* will ask you about the name of your subsystem, and then enter a "`command loop`".
In this command phase you can change the default settings for the coming generation phase, or just enter it.
You can always give a single question mark (followed by carriage return) to *toolmake* in order to get some brief help.
In some cases you can get further help with a HELP command.

If you are familiar with the ToolMaker system *toolmake* ought to be self explanatory.


== ARGUMENTS

name::
  The subsystem name, this is used as prefix for the generated files and all externally visible symbols in generated code.


== OPTIONS

-[-]go::
  [Do not] Enter the generation phase immediatly (default: off).
-[-]verbose::
  Enable [disable] verbose output mode (default: off). +
  Verbose mode will give some information regarding the actions choosen by *toolmake*.
-help::
  Gives you a brief but fresh help on the arguments and options to the *toolmake* program.


== FILES

The files generated differs naturally depending on target language, wanted components and generation level.
For the default case and a subsystem called *x*, the following ToolMaker description files will be generated:

////
The ordered list below is a bit tricky because we expect the following
numbering: x. y. z. a.
The only way to achieve this is to start a new list, although it
introduces a gap between the last element and its previous element.
So our best option is to treat each entry as a new list, so that
all elements are equally spaced.
////

[loweralpha, start=24]
. The common ToolMaker description file.

[loweralpha, start=25]
. The ScannerMaker description file.

[loweralpha, start=26]
. The ParserMaker description file.

[loweralpha, start=1]
. The ListerMaker description file.

And for your convience:

[loweralpha, start=24]
. An example main program.

// separator to forcefully end the list

Makefile::
  A suitable file for make(1).

For the default case the following source code files will be generated empty by toolmake:

xCommon.h::
  Subsystem common definitions, e.g. token definition.
xScSema.c, xScan.c, xScan.h::
  The scanner.
xPaSema.c, xParse.c, xParse.h::
  The parser.
xList.c, xList.h::
  The lister.
xErr.c, xErr.h::
  Error handler, interface between parser and lister.

Of course will they be filled when the proper makers are invoked.

To be able to use ToolMaker programs the environmental variable `TMHOME` should be set, probably to `/usr/local/ToolMaker`.
The origin for the generated files will be found in a language subdirectory to `$TMHOME/lib`, like `$TMHOME/lib/ansi-c`.


== DIAGNOSTICS

A number of diagnostic messages can appear when running *toolmake*.
See your _Toolmake Reference Manual_ for a detailed listing.

// @NOTE: Unlike the other man-pages, this one referenced them as (1),
//        instead of (L1) in the original. For consistency and simplicity
//        I used (L1) here too.
